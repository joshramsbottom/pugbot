# pugbot

A Discord bot for organising pickup games.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the bot up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Although these steps make use of yarn, npm can be used too.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (_Optional_)
* A Discord app token - go [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and create a new app, you can then reveal the token on the app's page

### Installing

Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/joshramsbottom/pugbot.git
```

Inside the directory, install required packages
```
yarn install
```

Lastly, create a file named `.env`, see [Setting up .env file](#setting-up-env-file) for what to put in it

## Usage

To run the bot in development mode with live reloading
```
yarn run develop
```

To compile the source and run manually
```
yarn run build
yarn start
```

## Setting up .env file

Pugbot uses environment variables for configuration, these are read from a file named `.env` in the root project directory when running the bot. This file should not be checked into version control and should be environment specific.

The contents of the file should be a series of lines containing `VAR_NAME=VALUE` where the following variables can be used:

Variable name | Value
------------ | -------------
TOKEN | Token generated by Discord for your app
OWNERS | List of Discord user IDs
PUGS_CHANNEL | Discord channel ID
PUGS_ANNOUNCEMENTCHANNEL | Discord channel ID
PUGS_ROLE | Discord role ID
TEMP_CHANNEL_LIFETIME | Time to keep temporary pickup game channels (milliseconds)
TEAM_SIZE | Number of players that make up a team in your chosen game
IDLE_TIME | Time after user goes AFK in Discord before they are removed from the queue (milliseconds)
TANK_ROLE | Discord role ID
DPS_ROLE | Discord role ID
SUPPORT_ROLE | Discord role ID
TANK_EMOJI | Discord emoji ID

An example `.env` file might look something like:
```
TOKEN=<insert token here>
OWNERS=183873160779792385
PUGS_CHANNEL=183878860331286530
PUGS_ANNOUNCEMENTCHANNEL=40716864976663347
PUGS_ROLE=393869466452099072
TEMP_CHANNEL_LIFETIME=3600000
TEAM_SIZE=6
IDLE_TIME=1200000
TANK_ROLE=402067038278909952
DPS_ROLE=402067250523275266
SUPPORT_ROLE=402067294173396992
TANK_EMOJI=<:tank:406977153884749844>
DPS_EMOJI=<:dps:406977114135330847>
SUPPORT_EMOJI=<:support:406977181789454339>
```

### How to get a role ID from Discord

While getting the ID of most things in Discord (channels, users) normally involves right click > "Copy ID", this does not currently work for roles on a Discord server.

In order to get a role's ID make sure the role is mentionable in server settings, then type this in a channel (note that this will actually also mention users with the role):
```
\@role_name
```
Your message should turn into something that looks like this after sending:
```
<@&402067038278909952>
```

The numeric part is the ID of the role you mentioned.

### How to get an emoji ID from Discord

This is very similar to [getting a role ID from Discord](#how-to-get-a-role-id-from-discord).

Just type the emoji name, including the surrounding `:`, preceeded by a `\`:
```
\:emoji_name:
```
Your message should turn into something that looks like this after sending:
```
<:emoji_name:406977153884749844>
```

The entire message including the `<>` is the emoji ID.
